                        The Charles Xavier School is a fictional school for gifted youngsters
                        in the Marvel Comics universe, which was founded by Professor Charles Xavier.
                        The school is located in North Salem, New York, and serves as a training
                        ground and safe haven for young mutants.

                        The school was first introduced in X-Men #1 in 1963 and has since become
                        a significant location in the X-Men franchise. In the comics, the school has
                        been destroyed and rebuilt several times, but it always remains a place of
                        refuge and education for young mutants who are trying to come to terms with
                        their powers and learn how to use them for good.

                        The Charles Xavier School has been depicted in various forms of media,
                        including the X-Men films and television series. In these adaptations,
                        the school is often shown as a large mansion with high-tech facilities and
                        hidden underground levels. The X-Men use the school as their headquarters,
                        and it serves as a base of operations for their missions to protect mutants
                        and humans alike.

                        Over the years, many mutant teams have been associated with the Charles
                        Xavier School, and many of their members have attended the school at some
                        point. Here are some of the most notable mutant teams that have been associated
                        with the Charles Xavier School in the comics:

                        and attended the Charles Xavier School.
